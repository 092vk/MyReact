--> DOM : document object model : a tree like structure in which all the componenst of a webpage are structured .

--> in native js , when we change any element the whole DOM gets repainted while in react there is a concept of virtual dom 

--> What is a Virtual DOM :
-- it is a copy of actual dom that exixts in browser, it is basically a js object tree , a structure that mirrors the actual dom 


--> whats the problem and how virtual dom solves it 
----- PROBLEMS :
1.Inefficient DOM updation
2.Large time in updation of dom when freqent changes are made 
3.Large nuber of repaints 
4.cross browser compatibility 


---> How virtual dom solves the problem and which ones 

1. So react insted of changing the real dom on each request , it changes the virtual dom 
2. virtual dom is just a copy of original dom, updating the virtual dom is a light weight operation , ,recat then compares the virtaul dom with the previous verison to determine the minimal set of changes needed to update the actual DOM 

3.REact also batch sevral updates into one , and then computes the most efficient way to implemnt the changes 

4. react also uses reconciliation which helps it to compute minimal changes to make 

5.react also helps in cross-browser compatibility
