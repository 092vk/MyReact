--> why to learn hooks ? 
-->

// so while natively using js ,if i am using same varibale at multiple locations in the page and i want them to change at the same time i have to target all of them ,i have to decide which once i have to change and which ones not , which is quite hectic , this is automated using react or reactive library , react makes the process of reacting automatic , if a value is present at multiple locations or at multiple pages , and if we change it , react will react for us and change it at all the locations , this is where react hooks comes in the picture .
