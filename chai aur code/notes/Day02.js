// ****why vite*****
// vite is a bundler - simply we use them becuz it bundles all the technology we need , so instead of installing the tech one by one , like tailwind and react separartely , we can use vite to install them in a one go ,they have other functions as well by which it helps in building the project efficiently and fastly 



// how??
// npm create vite@latest
// select the options 
// npm install -->install all the dependencies , also if you are copying a projec , after running this command all the dependencies which are missing from the computer will get installed automatically 


// npm run dev
